The idea here is pretty simple. Keep a mapping from each roman letter to its value.

 map.put('I',1);
 map.put('V' , 5);
 map.put('X', 10);
 map.put('L' , 50);
 map.put('C', 100);
 map.put('D' , 500);
 map.put('M' , 1000);
 
 Thus our mapping will look something like above. Next we iterate through each character in the string. Everytime the character is lesser
 than the next character we subtract the value of that character from the sum else add to sum. At the end we need to add the value of the last
 character in the string.
 
 For instance take the example : DCXXI.
 
 The value of D is greater than C. Thus our sum becomes 500.
 C is greater than X. Thus sum becomes 500 + 100 = 600.
 Next, X is equal to next X. Thus we add 10 to sum i.e 610.
 Again as X is greater than I , we add 10 and sum becomes 620.
 At the end we add the value of the last character i.e I to sum and sum becomes 621.
 
 We return 621 as our answer.
