Let us understand with an example. Suppose the given array is [-2,0,1,1,2].
We first sort the array and then start iterating. We add the first element -2 to the sum. Next we keep two pointers.
Pointer A will point to position 1 and element 0. Pointer B will point to position 4 and element 2.
As the sum is equal to 0 we add the elements to the answer.
Next we check if the element next to 0 is a 0. In that case we incremenet the left pointer. However here it is 1, so we skip.
Similarly we checck if 2 at index 4 is equal to 1 at index 3. As it is not, we do not decrement the right pointer.
At the end of this we need to decrement the Pointer B and incremenet Pointer A.
Now they point to -2 , 1 and 1 which sum to 0. We add all these three and put in the answer.
Similarly we can do for the rest of the array.
