The idea here is to maintain two indexes, one for 0 and one for 2. The index of 2 starts at the end. 
When we traverse the array, everytime we encounter a 2 we put it at the end of the array and decrement the index for insertion of 2 next time.
Everytime we encounter a 0, we swap it in the front part of the array and increment the index for insertion of 1.
Everytime we encounter a 1, we just increment the value of i. We iterate till i < length of the array.
