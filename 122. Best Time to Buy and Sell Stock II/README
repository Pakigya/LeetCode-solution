Here we simply have to just check if the current element is greater than the previous element. If so add the difference to the results.
For instance consider the array : [7,1,3,67,4]
Here 3 at index 2 is greater than 1 at index 1, so we add 2 to the result.
Similarly, 67 at index 3 is greater than 3 at index 2. So we add( 67 - 3) or 64 to the result. Result now becomes 66.
As no other element is greater than the previous element, we return 66 as the answer.
