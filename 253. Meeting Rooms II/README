The idea here is to first sort the intervals based on start values. Then everytime we add the end values
of every interval to a min heap. While inserting, we check whether the start value of this interval is 
greater than or equal to the peek element of the min heap. If so we remove the peek element from the priority
queue. At the end we return the priority queue size as our answer.
