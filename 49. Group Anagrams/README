The idea is to sort every word and put in a hasmap < String , ArrayList >. In this way, all the similar words will be 
put in the same key. 
For instance : ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"] for this array,
sorting eat will make it aet and we put it in a map of aet. 
Similarly, sorting tea will give aet and we put it in the same key. 
Sorting tan will give, ant and we put in this key.
Sorting ate will give aet and we put in the key aet.
Sorting nat will give ant and we put in this key. Thus key ant now contains tan and nat.
Similarly, sorting bat gives abt.
Thus our final answer would be ["eat","ate","tea"] in one group, ["tan" ,"nat"] in another group and ["bat"] alone.
