Let us understand this problem with the example array : [1,1,1,2,2,3,4,3,3,3,4,5].
Initially we store the count of each element in the array in a hashmap.
Thus our hasmap contains the following data:
1 - > 3
3 - > 4
5 - > 1
4 - > 1
2 -> 2

Next as the max in our case is 4, we make an array of 0 to 4 elements and add a list to each array element.
The idea is to use something like bucket sort. Hence, all keys having the same value will
go into the same bucket. Thus the array at index 4 will have 3 , one at index 3 will have the value 1, 
one at 2 will have 2, and the one at 1 will have index 4 and 5. Index 0 is empty.

Next we start from the last element in the array and keep adding all the elements in the array and the elements
in its list, till we get the first k count. Say for instance the k is 3, then we would have 3 , 1 , 2 as our list
and return the same as our answer.
