Let us take an example of the array : [0, 1, 0, 3, 12].
Let us first set count = 0. Now while iterating the array the first non zero entry is 1. Swap it with the element at position count.
Now the array becomes [1, 0, 0, 3, 12].
The next non zero element is 3 and the count now is 1. Swap element 3 with element at index 1.
Now the array becomes [1, 3, 0, 0, 12]. Now increment the count of "count" variable to 2.
The next non zero element is 12. Swap and we get [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
As we have iterated all the elements, we return this as the answer.
