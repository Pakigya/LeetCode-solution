Let us take the example test case :[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] is gas array and [ 3, 4 , 5 , 1 , 2] is the cost array.
Then the total array obtained by adding the successive difference of gas[i] and cost[i] would look like this:
[ -2 , -4 , -6 , 3 , 0]. As we can see, the minimum is at index 2. So we make the next element of this index as our starting point.
