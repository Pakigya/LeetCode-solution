The idea here is to use DFS like approach to explore the matrix. Everytime we move to the 4 possible directions we mark it as
0. Also we record whether we have travelled left , down, right or left at each point so that it can be used to track the 
duplicate ones. We put this result into the hashset and at the end return the set size.
