Let us take the example of :
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7
    
At first we set the next of root to null. We store the left of 1 i.e 2. Now we point the left of 1 i.e 2 to the right of 1 i.e. 3.
For 3 we check that the next of 1 is null, thus we set it to null.
Now our currentLevel will point to 2. We store the nextLevel as the leftChild of 2 i.e 4. We set the left of 2 to point to the right of 2.
For the right of 2 , we check whether the next of 2 is null or not. As 2 has a next i.e 3, we set the right of 2 to point to the left of 3.
Thus 5 will point to 6.
Now we make the left of 3 point to the right of 3. For the right of 3, we see that the next element of 3 is null, thus we point the right
of 3 to null. 
Now as the left of 4 is null, we termiate.
