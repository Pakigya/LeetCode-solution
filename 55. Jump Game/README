The idea is to simply move from the last index to the beginning index and check if the end can be reached from the beginning.
At each iteration, we check if ( i + nums[i] >= last). If so we set last to i. At the end we check to see if the last index is 0.

Lets take an example : [ 2 , 0 , 0 ]
Initially we set last to 2( i.e index of the last element).
Now we iterate from the second last element to the first element in the array.
At the second last index , i + nums[i] equals 1 which is not greater than or equal to last( i.e 2). Hence we do not update last.
At the first index, i + nums[i] == 2 which is equal to the last index and thus we update last as 0.

Finally as our last is 0, we return true.
