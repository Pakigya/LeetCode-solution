Let us understand through an example: [ 0 , 1, 3 ].
If our array is as given, then let us initialize a variable called xor that will be initally set to 0.
Next we iterate through the array and update the value of xor as follows :
xor = xor ^ i ^ nums[ i ];

Thus for our above array, xor will initally be 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 which is 0.
For the 2nd iteration, xor = 0 ^ 1 ^ 1 which is equal to 0.
For the last iteration xor = 0 ^ 2 ^ 3.

Now at then end the value of i, which is the number of iterations is 3.
Thus we do an XOR between the 'xor' value and 3. Thus we get 0 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 which is 2.
We return 2 as our answer.
