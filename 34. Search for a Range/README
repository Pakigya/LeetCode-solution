Let us take the example of this array : [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8.

Initially we compare the middle element 7 with the target element. As the target element is higher we set, start as mid + 1. Now our array under
consideration is restricted to the range [ 8 , 8 , 10]. 
Now our mid element is 8. As this is equal to our target we compare the start and end elements to the target. As the end element is not equal
to the target but the start element is equal to the target, we decrement the end position.
Now both our start and element equal to the target element and thus we return the index of these array as the element is found.
