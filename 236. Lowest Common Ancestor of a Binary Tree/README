Let us better understand from the below example :

         ______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
      
Say we wamt to find the LCA of 6 and 4. 
As our root element( 3 is different from both p = 6 and q = 4) we recursively call the function with the root.left.
In our case the left is 5. Again we call the function lowestCommonAncestor with root.left. In our case this is 6.
As our p value is equal to this value, we return root of this root.left i.e 5.

Then we call lowestCommonAncestor function with root.right i.e 2. Now we call the function recursively for element 7. We return null
from the left and right of both 7's children. Then we call the right of 2 and return null from left and right of both children of 4.

At this time as the left and right of the root are not same i.e 6 and 2 respectively, we return 5.
