The idea is to read the characters till we keep reading 4 characters and once we read less than 4
that means we are in the last read and we return after copying everything to buffer. Note that
after each read, need to copy to the buffer.
For instance take buffer as "a" and n = 0.
In this case the total read should be 0 and the string returned should be "".
Also when buffer is "a" and n == 1, total read should be 1 and should return a.
