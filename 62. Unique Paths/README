The idea here is to see that we can enter a particular cell from either top or left. We can find out that , for every cell, the different
ways to enter it are equal to the summation of ways to enter the top and the ways to enter the left cell.
Also we can see that if i == 0 or j == 0 , the solution for reaching that cell is always 1.
