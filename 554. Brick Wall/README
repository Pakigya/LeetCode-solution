The idea here is that we will use a map to store the successive sum of the bricks in any row other
than the last brick. If the sum is already present in the map, we increment the value of that sum key.
At the end, we subtract the key values of all the keys from the total number of rows. Remember that
the value corresponding to the key represents the number of rows having that sum i.e ending at that sum.
We want to find the difference between no. of rows and the value to get our result. For instance if
there are 4 rows out of 6, which have sum as 4, that means only two will cross the bricks if we draw a line
at this particular point.
