The idea here it to use a sliding window. Let us understand with an example string : "eceba" and k = 2.
We initialize an arr of size 256 to keep a count of each character. When we encounter the first 'e', we increment
the count of 'e' in the array to 1. Next, when we encounter c, we again increment the count of 'c' to 1.
At this time we have seen 2 distinct characters and the count of distinct characters is 2. Next, when we see another 'e'
we increment the count of 'e' to 2. However, the count of distinct characters is still 2. Next when we encouter the character
'b' we increment the count of 'b'. At this time we have seen 3 distinct characters and its count is greater than k. In this case,
we keep decrementing the count of each character from the left. Initially left is initialized to 0. We decrement the count of 'e'
from 2 to 1. As it is still greater than 0, we decrement the count of c from 1 to 0. At this point as it is 0, we break and continue
the above process.
