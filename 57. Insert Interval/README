The idea here is that if the current interval's end value is less than the start value of the given
interval, or the given interval is already added in the result, then we add the current interval to the
result. Else if the current interval's start value is more than the given interval's end value, then we 
add the given interval followed by the current interval to the result and set the added flag to true.
The other criteria is for merging. In this case, the given Interval's start value is the 
Math.min( givenInterval.start , current.start ) and given Interval's end value is Math.max(givenInterval.end ,
current.end). At the end we check whether the given Interval is already added to the result or not.
If not, we add it.
