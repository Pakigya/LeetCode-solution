The simple idea here is that we keep comparing every word character with every character of the abbreviation. If they are equal
we increment the index of both and continue. Else, if they are different, we need to make sure that they are not less than or equal to '0'
or more than '9'. In that case, we can return false. Otherwise, it means they are numbers and we keep appending till we see digits 0 -9.
After that we increment the count of word by this integer.
At the end we have to see if i == word.length() && j = abbr.length() where i and j are the index for word and abbr respectively.
