Let us take an example of the array: [ 1 ,2, 2, 3, 3, -4, -4].
Here we simply do an XOR of all the array elements. The elements that are coming twice
give 0 and the the single no. if returned as the answer. For instance in the above array
2 and 2 , 3 and 3 and -4 and -4 will cancel each other and thus 1 is returned as the ans.
