Let us take and example of the below tree :

         _____6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
       
Let us say we want to find the LCA of 5 and 3. As the root value is greater than both 5 and 3 , we make root as root.left.
Now the root value is 2. As the values 5 an 3 are both greater than 2, we make root as the right child of 2 i.e 4. Now as 5 and 3 
do not satisfy the below if conditions, we go to the else condition and return root i.e 4.

if ( root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val)
    root = root.right;
else if( root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val)
    root = root.left;
    
Thus our answer is 4.
