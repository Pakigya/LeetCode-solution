The iterative solution here is as follows :
Keep pushing all the left elements including the root to a stack.
Once we have pushed all the left elements, pop the top of the stack and push it in the final list.
Make the current root as the right child of the popped element.
Keep doing this till the stack is not empty and the root is not null.
