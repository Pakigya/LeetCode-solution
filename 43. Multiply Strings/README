Let us understand through an example :
122 * 38. Here we want to do multiplication as follows:
Initialize an array of size len1 + len2 where len1 is the length of String1 and
len2 is the length of String2. 
Then our array would look like this :
0   0   0   0   0

Now we add ( i + j) where i is the index of 2nd string and j is the index of 1st string.
Please note that these two digits can only affect the digits at position i + j which is the carry
and i + j + 1 which is the remainder digits of the result. When we add the remainder part do 
result[ remainder ] = sum % 10 whereas for carry resultant[ carry ] += sum.
Also be careful that sum is the summation of result[ remainder ] + multiplication of the digits.

At the end need to remove all trailing zeros and return answer.
