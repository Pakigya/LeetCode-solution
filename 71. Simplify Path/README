The idea is to first split the string based on "/". After this we skip if it is "." or "". If it is
".." , then pop() the last element from the stack. Else the other strings, we push it onto the stack.
At the end, for all the strings we append the strings to the end of the result. At the starting, we
have to add "/". If the string is empty at the end, we return "/" else return the result.
