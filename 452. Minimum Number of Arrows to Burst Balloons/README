Let us understand through an example.
[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
If this is the given array, we first sort based on the y value. After sorting, our interval array
would look as below:
[[1,6], [2,8],[7,12],[10,16]]
First we start by checking whether intervals from the 2nd position and beyond are between 6 i.e end
element of 1st interval. As 2,8 is we continue by incrementing the value of count. Next we see, [7,12] 
does not fall between 6 and thus we set end value now to 12. Now we check if 10,16 is between this .
As it is, we increment count from 1 to 2. Finally we return 2 as our answer.
