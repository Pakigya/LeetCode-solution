We can use two techniques here:
1. Every square number is of the format 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + .....
Thus for instance 25 is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9.

2. We can use binary search . Let us do a binary search between 1 and 25.
We find the mid element that is 13. As 13 * 13 > 25, we check only the left values.
Again as mid = 7 and 7 * 7 > 25, we check only from 1 to 6. Now similarly doing till end we get
5 as our answer.
