The idea here is to take the abbreviation as the key and the words are added in the form of a list to the key. If a key is already
present then the given word is added to the list of that key. While checking if the word is unique, we first generate the abbreviation.
After this we check if this abbreviation is a key in the map. If not we return true. If it is, we check to see if the given word has been
seen previously by traversing the arraylist of this key. We need to take a set to avoid duplicate cases.
