For instance lets take the example where the array is [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1, 5] and k = 2.

After creating the hashmap, we shall have the following map of < Element , Count >

< 3 , 1 >
< 1 , 2 >
< 4 , 1 >
< 5 , 1 >

Now we iterate through our mapset, and subtract k from it and check if the map still contains any key with this value.
If so we increase our count. 

3 - k = 1, and our map contains 1 key so we increment count. Value of count is now 1.
1 - k = -1 and our map does not contain -1 so we continue.
4 - k = 2 and our map does not contain 2 so we continue;
5 - k = 3 and our map contains the key "3" so we increment count. Value of count is now 2.
As we have traversed the entire map, we can now exit the for loop.


At the end we finally return count(2).
