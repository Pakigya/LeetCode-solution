The idea is to use a queue(BFS) to serialize and use "X" to denote null node and split node with a space.
We use a StringBuilder to store the string and then deserialize based on the same intuition.
Thus for instance the tree :
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
    
would be serialized as follows : 1 2 3 X X 4 5 X X X X. We only push nodes( non null) to the queue.

Now when we deserialize, 1 is made the root and 2 and 3 are the left and right child respectively. After this
as the values are X and X we simply skip. Then 4 is made the left child of 3 and 5 as the right child. Then again
all X are skipped. Here too, queue is used for deserializing.
