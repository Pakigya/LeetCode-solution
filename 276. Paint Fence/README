If k == 0 or n == 0 ,then there are 0 ways.
If n = 1, then there are k ways.
If n = 2, then either it can be same color which can be done in k ways or different colors( k * (k - 1) ) ways.
If n = 3, then if it is same color as previous then, same = k * ( k - 1).
If different colors then suppose the previous were same, then same * ( k - 1). Now considering different case,  diff * ( k - 1).
Thus total number of wasy for n == 3 is same * ( k - 1) + diff * ( k - 1).
Instead of using O(n) memory we can optimize it to O(1) by just considering two variables, diff and same instead of an array of n + 1 elements.
