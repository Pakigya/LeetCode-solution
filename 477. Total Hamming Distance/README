Let us understand through an example : [4, 14, 2].
4 - 0100
14 - 1110
2 - 0010
As seen from the binary representation of the above integers, we just need to take the 32 bit
representation of each digit and then get the number of set bits for each position. 
For instance , number of set bits in LSB of above integers is 0. Thus it contributes 0 to the 
hamming total.
Then, number of set bits in the 2nd bit from left is 2. Thus it contributes ,  2 * ( n - 2) or 2 to the 
total hamming distance.
Similarly, the number of set bits in the 3rd bit from left is 2. Thus it contributes 2 - ( n * 2) or 2 to
the hamming distance.
Again, for the MSB, the total number of 1s is 1. Thus it contributes 1 * ( n - 1) or 2 to the total hamming
distances.
Hence our answer is 2 + 2 + 2 or 6.
