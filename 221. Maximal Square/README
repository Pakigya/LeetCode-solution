The idea here is to use Dynamic Programming. Let us understand with an example.
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Supoose this is the given matrix. Allocate a matrix of size 5 * 6 called dp.
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
Now we check if the matrix element is 1. If so, we check the left , right and the 
diagnol element above this element. We take the minimum of them and add 1 to the value.
This would be the value of the diagnol element. Thus our dp matrix would look like this:

0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 2 2
0 1 0 0 1 0

We return 2 * 2 as our answer.
