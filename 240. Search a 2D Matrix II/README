The idea here is to strat from the top right corner. If the element at this position is equal to our search element, return it.
Else if the element to be searched is lesser than it, move to the left. Else start going down.

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Say the element to be searched is 5, we start from 15 and keep going left till we reach 4. At this point as 5
is greater than 4, we keep moving down. Eventually, we find 5 at the next spot after we move down from 4.

Say for instance the element we are searching for is 30. We keep moving down from 15 on top right till we move to 22. At this point
we start moving left till 16. Again at this point we keep moving down till 26. At this point we keep moving right till 18.
Now we cannot move down and thus we return false.
