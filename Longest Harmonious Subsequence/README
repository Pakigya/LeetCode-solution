For instance lets take the example where the array is [ 1, 3 , 2, 2 , 5 , 2 , 3 ,7]

After creating the hashmap, we shall have the following map of < Element , Count >

< 1 , 1 >
< 3 , 2 >
< 2 , 3 >
< 5 , 1 >
< 7 , 1 > 

Now we iterate through our mapset, and try to find the values whose difference of key is 1. If so we find the maximum of these counts
and return. Initialize max = 0;

Let us iterate through our map.
As our map contains the key 1 but and also contains the key 2, we update our max as 1 + 3 or 4.
As our map contains the key 3 but does not contain the key 4 , we continue.
As our map contains the key 2 and the key 3 , our max would be Math.max( map.get(2) + map.get(3) , max ) which is equal to 5.
As our map contains the key 5 but does not contain the key 6 , we continue.
As our map contains the key 7 but does not contain the key 8 , we continue.

Return max(5) as the answer.
