The simple logic here is to maintain a simple sliding window of 7 characters at a time and then move it by 1 till the end.
Thus for instance consider 
Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Here, first we add the first 4 nos. Then we subtract the first no from the running sum and add the 5th number. We check if this average is more.
Similarly we repeat for other elements.
