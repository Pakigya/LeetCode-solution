Let us consider the array : [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
For first element 4, we see that the number is positive. So we make the (element - 1) or 3rd index as negative. Thus our array becomes
[4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1].
Next we see that element 3 at index 1 is positive. Hence we make the element at index (3-1) as negative. Thus our array becomes 
[4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1].
Now for element at index 2, we make the (2-1) or 1st index as negative. Thus our array becomes [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1].
Next for element at index 3, we make the (7-1) or 6th index as negative. Thus our array becomes [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,1].
Now for element at index 4, we make the 7th index negative. Thus our array becomes [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1].
Now for the index 5, we see that the 2 - 1 is already negative. Thus we add 2 to our ans.
Also for the element at index 6, we see that the 2nd index is already negative. Thus we add 3 to our answer.
Finally for the last index we see that the 0th element is not negative and make it negative. 
Thus our array finally is [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1].
We return [2,3] as our answer.
