The idea is to note that every palindrome is made up of at most 1 odd number of character which occurs in the middle if present.
All the rest are even. Using this concept take a int[] array corresponding to 256 characters and increment their count. Now check if
any of their count is odd. If so check for another character whose count is odd. If true return false else return true.
