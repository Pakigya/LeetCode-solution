The basic idea here is to store every character of the word in a particular position of the 32 bits possible in an integer.
As there are only 26 characters that we need to account for, we can start off by putting the character 'a' in the 1st LSB,
'b' in the 2nd LSB , 'c' in the 3rd LSB and so on. 
Hence say we have two words, "abcd" and "def", to represent the word "abcd", we will set the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th LSB position
to 1 corresponding to a , b, c and d respectively. Thus our representation for the string "abcd" becomes 00000000000000000000000000001111.
This in integer would be 15. Now for the string "def" we have to set the 4th most, 5th most and 6th bit from the end to 1. Thus
our integer representation corresponding to this string becomes : 00000000000000000000000000111000. Now we do a logical AND between these 
two and see if it is 0. If so we multiply their lengths else we conclude that they have repetitive characters. In this case as the 4th bit
from the end is set for both the strings, we do not get 0 and thus the answer for these two strings is 0.
